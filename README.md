# TinyWorldModel

**TinyWorldModel** is a lightweight world modeling framework designed to support autonomous driving systems. It enables vehicles to understand, predict, and react to their surrounding environment by building a compact and efficient representation of the world.

## 1. Features

- **Lightweight Architecture**: Optimized for performance on resource-constrained platforms.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extendable with plug-and-play modules for perception, prediction, and simulation.
- **Sensor Fusion Support**: Integrates data from LiDAR, camera, radar, and other sensors.
- **Simulation & Testing Tools**: Includes built-in tools for environment simulation, visualization, and model evaluation.
- **Open Interface**: Compatible with common autonomous driving frameworks (e.g., ROS, Apollo).
